1\. What is a website, and how is it different from a web application?

A website is a collection of web pages that show information, like articles, photos, or videos. A web application is more interactive — it lets users do things, like log in, post content, or buy products. In short, a website mostly gives information, while a web app lets people use the site to do tasks.



2\. Why do you think organizations (like offices or schools) need websites?

Organizations need websites to share important information with people. It helps others know what they do, their services, and how to contact them. Websites also make it easier for students, workers, or customers to access updates anytime.



3\. What challenges did you encounter while creating your first repository?

At first, it can be hard to understand how to use GitHub — like how to upload files, commit changes, or fix errors. Some may also find it confusing to connect GitHub with their computer or use commands correctly.



4\. How might this practice of documentation (README) help in future projects?

Writing a README helps others understand your project easily. It explains what your project is, how to use it, and how it works. In the future, it can help you or your team remember the details and make updates faster.
